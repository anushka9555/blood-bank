# BloodConnect

BloodConnect is a web application designed to streamline the management of blood donations. This platform enables NGOs and similar organizations to efficiently handle donor data and facilitate the transfer of blood to hospitals in need. The website includes a robust authorization system, ensuring that only registered users can access and manage the sensitive data related to blood donations and requests.


## Key Features

*Separate User Roles* - 
Implemented distinct login/logout systems for donors, hospitals, organizations, and admins, providing tailored access and functionality based on user roles.

*Organization Management* - 
Each organization can view the list of donors registered to donate blood and the hospitals registered to receive blood, allowing for efficient management of blood donations and distributions.

*Donor and Hospital Sections* - 
Donors can log in to see which organizations they have donated blood to, while hospitals can log in to view the details of organizations and donors from whom they have received blood.

*Inventory System* - 
Developed an inventory management system to record and track the amount of blood donated or taken away from each organization, ensuring accurate and transparent operations.

*Analytics Dashboard* - 
Integrated an analytics page that shows real-time data on the amount of blood available for each blood group within an organization, along with totals for blood received and donated, updated with each transaction.
